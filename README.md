# Palindrome Birthdate Checker

This application is written using Javascript. It checks if the user's birthdate is a palindrome or not. If it's not a palindrome, then it displays the nearest palindrome to the birth date. (what is a palindrome : a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or nurses run.)

> Logic wise this is the most complicated program I have written. In coding world, Palindrome logic is considered like a beginner milestone, so this project gave me confidence. Also, UI wise, I have tried soemthing different this time. Normally pitch black and white shouldn't be used in apps/web, but i used to experiment. I gave my responsiveness skills a better approach here from the last app. I might change the UI after some suggestions from users.
